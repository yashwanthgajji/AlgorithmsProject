------------Instructions to run the program

- open the command line and navigate to src folder

- run the command "buildV1.sh" (or) "buildV2.sh" to generate the .class files and make sure it runs without any errors
    * buildV1.sh is to generate the build of class files of version 1 which is to find the ascending order and the time taken to run the program
    * buildV2.sh is to generate the build of class files of version 2 which is to find the height of the tree

- now we are ready to give inputs. Uncomment the lines 9, 10 or 11 in "MyMainV1.java" based on the kind of input you intend to give.
  line 9 -> Integer Input
  line 10 -> Double Input
  line 11 -> String Input

- run the program using the ./<fileName> <DataStructure to be used> <input file name>
  Ex : ./runV1.sh 3 input1

  The list of data structure and their corresponding integer is as follows:
  0. Hash Table
  1. Binary Search Tree
  2. Splay Tree
  3. Skip List
  4. Red Black Tree
