********** Instructions to run the program

Version 1:

This version when executed gives the output of the tree in sorted order and the execution time.

instructions to run Version 1:
- open the command prompt/terminal.
- check your present directory using the command "pwd"
- navigate to "src" folder using cd ./<path to src folder>
- enter "./buildV1.sh" to generate the .class files
- now we are ready to give inputs. Uncomment the lines 9, 10 or 11 in "MyMainV1.java" based on the kind of input you intend to give
    * line 9 -> Integer Input
    * line 10 -> Double Input
    * line 11 -> String Input
- in the terminal, type "./runV1.sh <DataStructure to be used> <input file name>" to run the program
    0. Hash Table
    1. Binary Search Tree
    2. Splay Tree
    3. Skip List
    4. Red Black Tree

    Ex: ./runV1.sh 2 input3

    output :

    Ascending order of data:
    0.7 7.3 40.3 70.0
    Time taken is : 16.414292 milliseconds


Version 2:

This version when executed gives the height of the tree after each operation(insert/delete)

instructions to run Version 2:
- open the command prompt/terminal.
- check your present directory using the command "pwd"
- navigate to "src" folder using cd ./<path to src folder>
- enter "./buildV2.sh" to generate the .class files
- now we are ready to give inputs. Uncomment the lines 8, 9 or 10 in "MyMainV2.java" based on the kind of input you intend to give
    * line 8 -> Integer Input
    * line 9 -> Double Input
    * line 10 -> String Input
- in the terminal, type "./runV2.sh <DataStructure to be used> <input file name>" to run the program
    1. Binary Search Tree
    2. Splay Tree
    4. Red Black Tree

    Ex: ./runV2.sh 1 input4

    output:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    4
    4


************* Comparison of Data structures based on their execution time

input :
1 5
1 4
1 6
1 3
1 5
0 7
0 5

output for:

Hash Table:
Ascending order of data:
3 4 5 6
Time taken is : 19.994583 milliseconds

Binary Search Tree:
Ascending order of data:
3 4 5 6
Time taken is : 18.162917 milliseconds

Splay Tree:
Ascending order of data:
3 4 5 6
Time taken is : 18.69275 milliseconds

Skip list:
Ascending order of data:
3 4 5 6
Time taken is : 19.623125 milliseconds

Red Black Tree:
Ascending order of data:
3 4 5 6
Time taken is : 18.37575 milliseconds
